##  Features

|      | Feature         | Summary       |
| :--- | :---:           | :---          |
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  |                  |
|  | **Key Components** | The server.js file enables an HTTP server that retrieves client data using the geoip-lite library. The package-lock.json and package.json files manage dependencies.                  |
| üîå | **Integrations**    |                  |
|  | **Geoip-lite Integration** | The project integrates with geoip-lite to facilitate geolocation-based functionality.                    |
|  | **npm Integration**     | The project uses npm as the package manager, with package-lock.json and package.json files managing dependencies.                  |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**     |                  |
|  | **Server Performance** | The server.js file enables an HTTP server that retrieves client data efficiently.                    |
|  | **Geolocation Data Retrieval** | Geolocation data is retrieved using the geoip-lite library, which provides efficient geolocation-based functionality.                 |

				<td>- The `package-lock.json` file serves as the backbone of the project's dependency management, outlining the required packages and their versions for the entire codebase<br>- This file ensures consistency and reproducibility across different environments, allowing for seamless collaboration and deployment.

In essence, this file achieves the following:

* Defines the project's dependencies on external libraries, such as `geoip-lite`, which is used to facilitate geolocation-based functionality.
* Establishes a baseline for package versions, enabling predictable behavior and minimizing potential conflicts during development or deployment.

By maintaining a well-structured `package-lock.json` file, the project ensures that all components are properly aligned, facilitating efficient maintenance, updates, and scaling.</td>
